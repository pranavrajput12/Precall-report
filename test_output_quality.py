    Drushi Thakkar: Hi Michelle! I saw your recent post about A'reve Studio's Series A funding round.
    Congratulations on raising $15M! I'm particularly interested in your approach to boutique fitness
    and how you're scaling in Central America and the Caribbean. Your focus on community-driven
    fitness experiences really resonates with current market trends.

    Michelle Marsan: Thank you, Drushi! Yes, we're incredibly excited about this milestone.
    The Series A will help us expand our technology platform and open 5 new locations across
    the region. We're always looking for innovative partners who understand the unique challenges
    of scaling in emerging markets. What's your background in this space?

    Drushi Thakkar: I work with Series A companies like yours to implement AI-powered operational
    automation that can increase efficiency by 50-100x while reducing costs. Given your expansion
    plans and the operational complexity of managing multiple locations, this could be perfect
    timing. I've helped similar fitness companies streamline member management, class scheduling,
    and inventory across multiple locations. Would you be open to a brief call to explore how
    this could accelerate A'reve Studio's growth trajectory?

    Michelle Marsan: That sounds interesting, Drushi. We're definitely looking at ways to optimize
    our operations as we scale. Can you share some specific examples of the results you've achieved
    with other fitness companies? I'd also like to understand more about the implementation timeline
    and what kind of support you provide during the transition.

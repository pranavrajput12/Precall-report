We\u2019re very focused on bridging digital and clinical workflows to improve care for patients managing chronic conditions. What brings you to the mental health innovation space?\n\n---\n\n## IMMEDIATE RESPONSE\n\nHi Michael, thanks for your thoughtful reply. My passion for this space comes from seeing gaps in mental health access firsthand\u2014especially how tech can transform patient engagement. Your recent article on \u201cHow AI is Humanizing Patient Care\u201d really resonated with me. MindBridge\u2019s blend of behavioral science and seamless EHR integration is impressive. Would you be open to a brief virtual coffee to explore industry trends and potential collaboration?  \n[Word Count: 78 words]\n\n---\n\n## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE\n\n### Follow-up 1 (Day 3-4)\n\nHi Michael, following up as I keep seeing MindBridge\u2019s momentum\u2014congrats again on your pilot with the health system and the recent funding round. I recently came across a case study on how integrated AI platforms drove significant ROI for chronic care management teams (happy to share). Curious: what challenges are you seeing with provider adoption or workflow integration? If helpful, would love to exchange insights on scaling digital therapeutics in real-world settings.  \n[Word Count: 77 words]\n\n---\n\n### Follow-up 2 (Day 7-10)\n\nHi Michael, wanted to share a quick industry insight\u2014there\u2019s growing interest from payers in value-based contracts for digital therapeutics, especially with proven outcomes like those MindBridge is showing. In my network, I\u2019ve seen early adopters accelerate clinician buy-in through targeted change management. If you\u2019re exploring similar strategies, I\u2019d be glad to connect you with peers or send relevant resources. Would a 20-minute call next week add value for you?

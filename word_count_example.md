# LinkedIn Message Word Count Feature

## Overview
The LinkedIn message generation system now includes automatic word count tracking for all generated messages. This helps ensure messages are concise and within LinkedIn's optimal engagement ranges.

## What's Changed

### 1. Prompt Updates
The LinkedIn reply generation prompts now include:
- **Immediate Response**: 50-100 words target
- **Follow-up Messages**: 75-125 words each
- Word count reporting requirements in the output format

### 2. Output Format
Generated messages now include:
- `[Word Count: X words]` after each message
- A `WORD COUNT SUMMARY` section at the end with:
  - Individual message word counts
  - Total word count across all messages

### 3. API Response
The workflow API response now includes a `word_count_info` field containing:
```json
{
  "word_count_info": {
    "individual_counts": [52, 75, 82],
    "message_stats": {
      "immediate_response": 52,
      "followup_1": 75,
      "followup_2": 82,
      "total": 209
    },
    "has_word_counts": true
  }
}
```

## Example Output

When the system generates LinkedIn messages, it will now produce output like:

```

Hi Sarah,

I noticed your recent post about digital transformation challenges in healthcare. Your insights on patient data integration really resonated with me. 

I've helped similar organizations streamline their data workflows, reducing integration time by 60%. Would you be interested in a brief conversation about how we've tackled these exact challenges?

Best regards,
John

Subject: Quick thought on your data integration challenge

Hi Sarah,

I came across this case study about a healthcare provider who solved similar patient data integration issues. They reduced manual data entry by 75% and improved accuracy significantly.

The approach they used might be relevant to your current initiatives. Happy to share the details if you're interested. 

What's your biggest priority with data integration right now - speed, accuracy, or compliance?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

## WORD COUNT SUMMARY
* Immediate Response: 52 words
* Follow-up 1: 75 words
* Follow-up 2: 82 words
* Total Word Count: 209 words
```

## Benefits

1. **Optimal Engagement**: Messages stay within LinkedIn's recommended length for maximum engagement
2. **Quality Control**: Easy to verify messages meet length requirements
3. **Analytics**: Track message length patterns over time
4. **Compliance**: Ensure messages don't exceed platform limits

## Implementation Details

- Word counts are extracted using regex patterns from the generated content
- The extraction is resilient to formatting variations
- If word counts aren't found in the output, the system returns empty data rather than failing
- The feature works for both streaming and non-streaming workflow executions

# Product Explainer (For Non-Experts)

## What is This Platform?

This platform is a smart assistant builder. It lets you create, test, and monitor digital assistants ("agents") that can read, understand, and respond to messages, emails, or other data—automatically.

## What Can You Do With It?
- **Automate repetitive tasks** (like replying to emails or analyzing conversations)
- **Build custom workflows** (a series of steps, each handled by a different assistant)
- **Test and improve assistants** before using them in real situations
- **See how everything is working** in real time, with clear dashboards

## How Does It Work? (Simple Version)

1. **You create assistants (agents):**
   - Give each a name, a job, and a personality (e.g., "Scout" for research, "Lexi" for writing replies)
   - Set their goals and what they should focus on

2. **You design a workflow:**
   - Decide the steps (e.g., "analyze message", "find answer", "write reply")
   - Assign an assistant to each step

3. **You test and run workflows:**
   - Try out your workflow with real or sample data
   - See what each assistant does at every step

4. **You monitor and improve:**
   - Use dashboards to see how well your assistants are working
   - Get feedback and suggestions for improvement
   - Make changes and test again

## What Makes It Special?
- **Easy to use:** Visual interface, no coding needed for most tasks
- **Customizable:** You decide what each assistant does and how they do it
- **Transparent:** See every step, result, and suggestion in one place
- **Safe to experiment:** Test before using in real situations

## Who is it For?
- Teams who want to automate communication or research
- Anyone who wants to build smart digital assistants without being an AI expert
- People who want to monitor and improve their automated workflows easily

## The User Journey (Example)
1. **You log in and create a new assistant called "Scout" to research LinkedIn profiles.**
2. **You add another assistant, "Lexi", to write email replies.**
3. **You design a workflow: Scout analyzes, Lexi replies.**
4. **You test the workflow with a real LinkedIn profile and email.**
5. **You check the dashboard to see how Scout and Lexi performed.**
6. **You tweak their instructions and try again until you’re happy.**

## Quality Standards for Messages

### LinkedIn Messages
- **Initial Message**: 80-100 words (automatically enforced)
- **Follow-ups**: 3 messages, each 75-125 words
- **Quality Criteria**: Personalization, value proposition, clear call-to-action, professional tone

### Email Messages
- **No strict word limits** but concise is better
- **Subject lines required** for all emails
- **Follow-up timing**: Typically 6-9 days between messages
- **Additional quality checks**: Clarity and appropriate urgency

### What Makes a High-Quality Message?
- **Personalized**: References specific details about the recipient
- **Clear Value**: Explains what benefit you're offering
- **Action-Oriented**: Has a specific next step
- **Professional**: Appropriate tone for business communication

## In Short
This platform helps you build, test, and monitor smart digital assistants for your business—no deep technical knowledge required! All messages are automatically evaluated for quality to ensure professional, effective communication.

# Safe Implementation Plan for CrewAI Workflow Platform Fixes

This document outlines a careful approach to implementing fixes for the identified issues in the CrewAI Workflow Orchestration Platform while ensuring that no working features break during the process.

## Guiding Principles

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test thoroughly before and after each change.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility for all APIs and interfaces.

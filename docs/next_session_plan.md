# Next Session Plan - Continue Tomorrow

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 1. Frontend Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Verify that workflow outputs now display correctly in UI

**Steps**:
1. Start frontend development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to AllRuns page
3. Verify that existing workflow executions show:
   - Immediate responses
   - Follow-up sequences  
   - Quality scores
   - Complete output data
4. Test expand/collapse functionality
5. Test copy and export features

**Expected Outcome**: All workflow outputs visible and properly formatted

### 2. Complete End-to-End Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Ensure all 3 dashboards show workflow data

**Test Workflows**:
```bash
# LinkedIn Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/workflow/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "linkedin_workflow",
    "channel": "LinkedIn",
    "conversation_thread": "Test conversation",
    "prospect_profile_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/test",
    "prospect_company_url": "https://linkedin.com/company/test",
    "prospect_company_website": "test.com",
    "_executed_by": "final_test"
  }'

# Email Test  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/api/workflow/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "email_workflow", 
    "channel": "Email",
    "conversation_thread": "Test email thread",
    "_executed_by": "final_test"
  }'
```

**Verification Points**:
- [ ] AllRuns page shows new executions with full outputs
- [ ] Observability page shows performance metrics
- [ ] Evaluation page shows quality assessments

### 3. Documentation Update (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Files to Update**:
- `README.md` - Update with latest features and fixes
- `CLAUDE.md` - Update development commands and notes
- `docs/system_architecture_reference.md` - Update with current state
- `docs/api_documentation.md` - Update endpoint details

### 4. Final Commit and Push (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Commit Message Template**:
```
Fix frontend output display and complete workflow integration

- Fix AllRuns.js field mapping for workflow outputs
- Fix app.py database field mapping from results to output_data  
- Enhance output parsing for workflow results structure
- Update statistics and export functions for new data format
- Complete integration of evaluation and observability systems
- Verify Azure OpenAI integration working properly

Resolves frontend output display issues and completes full-stack integration.
```

## üîß TECHNICAL CHECKLIST

### Backend Verification
- [ ] Backend running on port 8100
- [ ] Database connections working
- [ ] Azure OpenAI responding to requests  
- [ ] All API endpoints responding
- [ ] Workflow execution completing successfully

### Frontend Verification  
- [ ] Frontend starts on port 3000
- [ ] AllRuns page loads without errors
- [ ] Workflow outputs display correctly
- [ ] All dashboard pages functional
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Data Verification
- [ ] Database contains execution records
- [ ] output_data field properly populated
- [ ] Evaluation scores calculated and stored
- [ ] Observability metrics collected
- [ ] No orphaned or malformed records

## üêõ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO WATCH

### 1. Frontend Build/Start Issues
**Symptoms**: npm start fails, dependency errors
**Solution**: Run `npm install` if needed, check package.json

### 2. Backend CORS Issues  
**Symptoms**: Frontend can't reach API
**Solution**: Verify CORS settings in app.py allow localhost:3000

### 3. Data Format Mismatches
**Symptoms**: Outputs still not displaying  
**Solution**: Check browser dev tools, verify API response format

### 4. Azure OpenAI Rate Limits
**Symptoms**: Authentication or quota errors
**Solution**: Check Azure OpenAI usage and limits

## üìä SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Success
- [ ] Frontend displays workflow outputs correctly
- [ ] No critical errors in console/logs
- [ ] Basic functionality working

### Full Success  
- [ ] All 3 dashboards showing complete data
- [ ] New workflow executions work end-to-end
- [ ] Quality scores and metrics displaying
- [ ] Export/copy functions working
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] All changes committed and pushed

## üéØ SESSION GOALS

1. **Primary**: Verify frontend fixes resolve output display issue
2. **Secondary**: Complete full-stack testing of workflow system  
3. **Tertiary**: Update documentation and commit changes

## ‚è∞ ESTIMATED TIME

- Frontend testing: 15-30 minutes
- End-to-end workflow testing: 30-45 minutes  
- Documentation updates: 30-45 minutes
- Final commit and cleanup: 15-30 minutes

**Total**: 1.5-2.5 hours

## üìù NOTES FOR TOMORROW

- Backend server already configured and should start cleanly
- Azure OpenAI credentials hardcoded and working
- Database schema is correct and populated
- Main focus should be verifying the frontend fixes work as expected
- If frontend issues persist, may need to debug the specific data parsing logic
- All major backend issues have been resolved, so focus can be on UI/UX

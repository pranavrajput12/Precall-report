# Session Summary - July 24, 2025

## Work Completed

### 1. Frontend Output Display Fix
- **Issue**: Frontend AllRuns.js component was not properly displaying workflow outputs
- **Root Cause**: Field name mismatch between backend API and frontend expectations
- **Resolution**: 
  - Updated AllRuns.js to check both `run.output_data` and `run.output` fields
  - Enhanced output parsing logic to handle workflow results structure
  - Fixed statistics calculations to use correct field mappings
  - Updated copy and export functions to work with new data structure

### 2. Backend Database Field Mapping Fix
- **Issue**: app.py was incorrectly mapping workflow results to database
- **Root Cause**: Line 184 mapped `execution.get('results', {})` to `'output_data'` field
- **Resolution**: Changed to `execution.get('output_data', execution.get('results', {}))`

### 3. Azure OpenAI Integration
- **Status**: Successfully configured and working
- **Credentials**: Hardcoded in agents.py for immediate functionality
- **Authentication**: All workflow executions now using proper Azure OpenAI endpoints

### 4. Database Integration
- **Status**: Fully operational
- **Features**: 
  - Execution history tracking with proper ID generation
  - Evaluation results storage
  - Observability metrics collection
  - Thread-safe operations with upsert logic

### 5. CrewAI Task Execution
- **Status**: Fixed and working properly
- **Pattern**: Using Crew.kickoff() instead of task.execute()
- **Performance**: Realistic execution times (67-72ms)

## Current Status

### Backend (Port 8100)
- ✅ FastAPI server running with auto-reload
- ✅ Azure OpenAI integration working
- ✅ Database operations functional
- ✅ Workflow execution through CrewAI working
- ✅ Evaluation and observability systems integrated

### Frontend (Port 3000)
- ⚠️ Needs testing with latest backend fixes
- ✅ AllRuns.js updated to handle new data structure
- ✅ Field mappings corrected for output display

### Database
- ✅ SQLite database with proper schema
- ✅ Execution history populated with 22+ records
- ✅ Evaluation and observability tables created
- ✅ Thread-safe ID generation implemented

## Issues Resolved

1. **UNIQUE constraint failed: execution_history.id**
   - Fixed with proper upsert logic and thread-safe ID generation
   
2. **'Task' object has no attribute 'execute'**
   - Fixed by using CrewAI Crew.kickoff() pattern
   
3. **Frontend only showing inputs, not outputs**
   - Fixed field mapping between backend and frontend
   
4. **Azure OpenAI authentication errors**
   - Fixed with proper credential configuration

## Pending Tasks

1. **Test frontend fixes** - Verify workflow outputs display correctly in UI
2. **Documentation updates** - Update all documentation files
3. **Final testing** - Complete end-to-end testing of all systems
4. **Commit and push** - Save all changes to repository

## Technical Architecture

### Workflow Execution Flow
1. API receives workflow request
2. WorkflowExecutor runs multi-agent workflow via CrewAI
3. Results saved to database with proper field mapping
4. Observability and evaluation data collected
5. Frontend displays results with enhanced parsing

### Data Structure
- **Database**: `output_data` field contains workflow results
- **Frontend**: Checks both `output_data` and `output` for compatibility
- **API**: Maps execution results to proper database fields

## Next Session Priorities

1. Start frontend dev server and test output display
2. Verify all 3 dashboards (AllRuns, Observability, Evaluation) show data
3. Run final API tests with LinkedIn and Email workflows
4. Update all documentation files
5. Commit and push all changes

“No. Our success fee applies only to the funds raised in the round we’re actively involved in. If that same investor reinvests or increases their stake in later rounds—when Qubit isn’t part of the outreach—there’s no additional fee for that subsequent investment.”,"If an investor invests more money later (e.g., in a future round) without Qubit’s involvement, do we still owe a success fee?","

We carefully analyze your sector, stage, geography, and funding needs to identify relevant investors from our global network, ensuring highly targeted and effective outreach. Our fundraising experts support you from investor introductions, pitch deck refinement, negotiations, all the way until funds successfully reach your account.",How can you help us raise funds?,,
"We are sector and stage agnostic, we work with startups at all the stages.

Minimum which we have raised is $150k and Maximum we have raised is $25Mn. But the majority of our clients raise in the range of $1Mn-$5Mn.",What is the average ticket size which you raise/ What is your sweet spot?,,
"“Yes, in certain scenarios our fee structure scales. For amounts under $5M, the 4% rate is typical; for raises above $10M, it can drop to 3% or 2.5%. However, we finalize this in the engagement letter once we know your target range. If your round ends up being larger than initially expected, we adjust the success fee accordingly.”",Does the 4% success fee change if the raise is much bigger or smaller than planned?,,
"Our success rate is between 30 to 35%. We never claim that we are 100% successful. Nobody in this world can be 100% successful for startup fundraising.

If you compare it with the industry standard, the industry standard is in single digit. That's 7 to 8% and ours is almost three to four times the industry standard. The only reason why we are able to maintain a higher success rate is because we are using the hybrid model wherein we are using our twelve-year-old expertise in dealing with the investors, closing the deals, along with the new age technology which we have created of doing the matchmaking between the startup and the investor.",What is your success rate?,,
"It depends on the valuation of the company.

We identify all the potential investors for you from our network and outside our network as well and reach out to those investors on your behalf.

The investors who are in our direct network, we directly share the deal with them but the investors who are outside our network, we also share the deal with them because they are looking to invest in these kind of companies and we are solving a very big problem at their end in identifying the right startups and we provide them with the curated dealflow.",Is it a cold reachout which you will be doing to pitch these investors?,,
"“We’re flexible about collaborating with your internal teams or any external advisors you’ve engaged.

Qubit Capital does not assist with any form of debt financing or loans.,What are the different ways of Debt financing you can offer us? / Do you offer Debt financing or loans,,
"“We never blast your pitch to thousands randomly. Our AI and manual vetting yield a short list of relevant investors (usually a couple hundred at most, often fewer). We then do a phased outreach, gauging interest carefully so you maintain a sense of scarcity and exclusivity with prospective investors.”",We worry about saturating the market with our pitch. How do you limit the number of investors approached so we don’t come across as desperate?,,
"Marquee Equity is a marketing platform for startups which can broadcast your deal to the entire database of investors they have. Whereas Qubit Capital is a tech driven investment banking firm where we leverage technology to identify the relevant investors for your company and then help you close the deal through our fundraising experience.

If you want to market your business in front of the random investors, then Marquee is the right platform for you.

"We work on a reverse approach where we first onboard the investors, we understand their investment thesis in detail, the kind of startups they are looking for to invest in, from which industry they're looking for, from which geography, what should be their stage, what should be the deal size and based on that thesis our system identifies all the potential and relevant startups who can be a right fit for these investors and finds out the contact information of the founders and senior team members.

Then our team members reach out to the founders to set up a meeting with us and that's how we are talking right now.",How do you get to know about my company?,,

"We have been in this industry for the past 12 years. Qubit capital as a brand is a four-year-old brand but before that we were working as a traditional investment banker in the name of 360 financials which is a twelve-year-old Investment Banking firm. There we helped various startups and SMEs raise their capital via equity, debt, we have done various IPOs as well so we have a very strong network of hundreds of investors across the globe.

Over the period we have realised that having that limited network of investors is not enough because it is not practical every time that only the investor who is in our direct network, can be a right fit for all the startups, there can be hundreds of investors outside our network who can be a right fit for them, who can fund them. That's where in 2020, we created this proprietary technology and had started onboarding other investors as well who were outside our network.

We have a dedicated team of Investor Relations whose job is just to get on calls with these investors, build relations with them and understand their thesis. Apart from this we have subscriptions of various public and private platforms through which we are gathering the data of the investors and our system is learning their thesis using the Machine Learning Algorithm.

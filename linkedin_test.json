Delivered Avatar Avatar Ivy Yu 00:51 Hi Rhea,\n\nThank you so much for your kind message and for reaching out. I'm grateful that Bridal.Global resonated with youâ€”it's been a long journey, and the mission to uplift authentic bridal vendors is truly close to my heart.\n\nI'd be happy to share more about our fundraising experience and challenges so far, and I'd also love to hear what kind of companies or sectors you're currently exploring as a Research Analyst at Qubit.

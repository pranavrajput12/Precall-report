I\u2019ve been following Hydra EVC\u2019s growth\u2014your recent partnerships with property developers and the rollout of Hydra Cloud really set a new bar for smart EV infrastructure. Given your focus on operational excellence and scaling, I\u2019d love to share a brief industry insight we\u2019re seeing around optimizing charger utilization for new developments.

Out of curiosity, are there any particular challenges you\u2019re seeing as Hydra scales installations across diverse property types? I\u2019d be happy to share a short case study from a recent mixed-use project we supported that unlocked 20% higher charger uptime.

It highlights how advanced analytics are helping property partners boost ROI and charger engagement\u2014very relevant with the 2030 ICE ban on the horizon. If you\u2019d like, I can introduce you to a peer in property tech who recently tackled similar scalability hurdles with smart grid integration.
